Secure Authentication:

Guard Login: A simple and secure PIN-based login system for guards.

Admin Login: A robust login system for administrators, ready for real Microsoft and Google accounts, with a "dummy" login for easy local testing.

Session Management: Uses modern JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to keep users securely logged in.

Complete Visitor Workflow:

Check-in: Captures all required visitor details, including name, email, phone, host employee, and photos.

Check-out: Allows guards to mark visitors as having left, recording the checkout time.

Automated Approval System (Ready for Production):

Integrates with Microsoft Graph API to read a designated Outlook inbox for pre-approval emails.

Can send real-time approval requests with "Approve/Deny" buttons to employees via Microsoft Teams.

Integrates with Google Workspace to perform the same approval checks on a designated Gmail account and send notifications to Google Chat.

Intelligent Search & Data Handling:

Autocomplete Search: Provides fast, "Google-like" search suggestions for employees and returning visitors.

Returning Visitor Detection: Automatically identifies visitors who have been to the office before and can pre-fill their information.

File Storage: Securely uploads all captured photos (visitor and ID card) to your private AWS S3 bucket, organized by company.

Reporting APIs:

End-of-Day Report: An endpoint that calculates who is still inside and who has left for the day.
